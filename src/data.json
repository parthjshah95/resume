At Abilitare, I help build the head-controlled mouse, which is a hands-free alternative for those with hand disabilities to operate computers and smartphones.<br><br> When not helping the disabled gain digital access, I like fooling around with deep learning architectures, cooking and sketching.",

This thesis proposes two learnt techniques to provide high degrees of compression, albeit lossy, to significantly reduce a checkpoint’s size. It is shown that these methods compare favorably with the leading lossy compressors like ZFP and offer far higher compression ratios than lossless compressors like Gzip. The first method utilizes tucker decomposition while the second uses autoencoders for reducing the dimensionality of floating point tensors. Both are subsequently coupled with the product quantizer to efficiently discretize floating point numbers into integers. The popular OpenFOAM toolkit and the exascale XGC simulator are used to evaluate compression errors.",
